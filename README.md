# K-MeansClustering
This is a K-Means Clustering application which is writed using C# programming language on Visual Studio 2017. 
In this program k value can be chosen 2 or 3 using numericUpDown. 
Center of clusters are selected from first and second rows in data file. 
Algorithm runs until the nearest points are found. 
But in some cases there could be a infinity loop or a condition which cause program run unnecessary. 
Because of this there is a loop breaker. 
Also you can change the repeat count of loop breaker. 
It set 100 by default.

Source code will be added soon.
